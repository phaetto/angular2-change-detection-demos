# Angular 2 advanced change tracking

_Having problems with angular? Yeah, us too._

This repo has been taken from the exellent work of thoughtram:
https://github.com/thoughtram/angular2-change-detection-demos

This expands with another section that includes advanced examples (OnPush Change Detection (Advanced))

It allows someone to experiment with some more examples of the interaction of the change detection abilities (OnPush/detach/markForCheck/detectChanges)
